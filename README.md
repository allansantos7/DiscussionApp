  <h4>Project Vision and Overview</h4>
  &emsp; The problem our software addresses is the fragmented and complex communication between students and professors on academic topics. </br>
  Current communication software used by students often feels disconnected from the topics it serves, both in communication and discussion between students and professors.</br>
  &emsp;Current software applications like Discord, Teams, Slack, and Piazza each have a niche in the industry. </br>
  Teams and Slack dominate larger enterprise communication with numerous integrations and functionalities. </br>
  Discord is utilized by smaller companies and for personal/private use with easy-to-use voice and text options that provide flexibility.</br>
  Piazza, with forum-like posting and a focus on academic collaboration, enables effective topic-based communication easily moderated by professors.</br>
  &emsp;We can eliminate the limitations of Discord, Teams, Slack, and Piazza with the perspective of building a communication and discussion platform focused on academia. </br>
  Discord feels a bit too unorganized at times, Teams and Slack have awkward forum posting and topic posting creation, and Piazza seems to lack current UI/UX design and an easier way to connect with other students. </br>
  Our solution would involve finding what each app does well and focus on implementing them together in one application.</br>
  Our solution would enable university students and professors to communicate easily in multiple ways using a single software solution. </br>
  This includes ways for professors to set and manage topics and students, while also allowing for freedom and flexibility of communication among the students. </br>
  We want to incorporate well managed topics and a hard focus on an academic “feel” so that students and professors can stay on topic while also feeling free to communicate in multiple ways.</br>
